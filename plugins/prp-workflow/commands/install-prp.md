# Install PRP Templates

This command will install the PRP (Product Requirements Prompt) templates from the NanoBoom/plugins repository to your project.

## Task: Install PRP Templates to Project Root

Please perform the following steps to install the PRP templates:

1. First, check if a PRPs directory already exists in the project root. If it does, ask the user if they want to:
   - Overwrite it completely (delete and re-download)
   - Skip the installation
   - Backup the existing directory first (rename to PRPs.backup.<timestamp>)

2. Download the PRPs directory from the GitHub repository:
   - Repository: <https://github.com/NanoBoom/plugins>
   - Path: prp-workflow/PRPs
   - Target: Project root directory

3. Use one of the following methods to copy the PRPs directory:

   **Method A - Using git sparse checkout (preferred):**
   - Create a temporary directory
   - Clone the repository with sparse checkout enabled
   - Configure sparse checkout to only get the prp-workflow/PRPs directory
   - Copy the PRPs directory to the project root
   - Clean up the temporary directory

   **Method B - Using GitHub API (if git sparse checkout fails):**
   - Use the GitHub API to download the directory contents
   - Recreate the directory structure in the project root

4. After successful installation:
   - List the installed PRP templates
   - Show a summary of what was installed
   - Provide instructions on how to use the PRP templates

5. Verify the installation:
   - Check that all .md files in the PRPs directory are readable
   - Report the total number of PRP templates installed

## Error Handling

- If the GitHub repository is not accessible, provide clear error message
- If there are permission issues, suggest running with appropriate permissions
- If network issues occur, suggest retrying or manual installation steps

Please proceed with the installation now.
