# PRP Main Workflow Plugin for Claude Code

## Overview

The PRP (Product Requirements Prompt) Workflow plugin is a comprehensive system for AI-driven feature development that enables systematic research, planning, and execution of software features. It provides a structured approach to transforming ideas into working code through well-defined workflows and documentation.

## Features

### Core Capabilities

- **Systematic Research**: Deep codebase analysis and external research for informed development
- **Structured Documentation**: Create comprehensive PRPs that enable one-pass implementation success
- **Parallel Execution**: Support for concurrent POC development and task execution
- **Complete Lifecycle**: From initial planning to final implementation and validation
- **Expert Agents**: Specialized agents for codebase analysis and library research

### Design Philosophy

The plugin follows these core principles:
- **KISS**: Keep It Simple, Stupid - Simple solutions over complex ones
- **YAGNI**: You Aren't Gonna Need It - Solve only current problems
- **DRY**: Don't Repeat Yourself - Consolidate duplicated logic
- **Single Responsibility**: Each task changes one thing
- **Ockham's Razor**: Choose the simplest solution that works

## Commands

### Base PRP Commands

#### `/base-create [feature-name]`
Create a comprehensive base PRP with systematic research and context curation. This command:
- Performs deep codebase analysis
- Conducts external research
- Generates a complete PRP document
- Ensures one-pass implementation success

#### `/base-execute [prp-file]`
Execute an existing base PRP to implement the specified feature. Follows the PRP document to deliver working code.

### Planning and Specification

#### `/planning-create [feature]`
Create strategic planning documents for complex feature development with:
- High-level architecture decisions
- Component breakdown
- Risk assessment
- Timeline estimation

#### `/spec-create [requirements]`
Generate detailed technical specifications from requirements including:
- API contracts
- Data models
- Integration points
- Technical constraints

#### `/spec-execute [spec-file]`
Execute technical specifications to implement features according to the defined spec.

### User Story Management

#### `/story-create [feature]`
Create user stories with:
- Clear acceptance criteria
- Implementation details
- Testing requirements
- Definition of done

#### `/story-execute [story-file]`
Execute user stories to deliver feature implementations that meet all acceptance criteria.

### Task Management

#### `/task-create [feature]`
Break down features into actionable development tasks with:
- Clear dependencies
- Time estimates
- Resource requirements
- Success criteria

#### `/task-execute [task-id]`
Execute individual tasks from the task list with progress tracking.

#### `/task-list-init [project]`
Initialize and organize task lists for systematic development:
- Create task hierarchy
- Set priorities
- Define workflows
- Track progress

### Proof of Concept

#### `/poc-create-parallel [feature]`
Create proof-of-concept implementations with parallel execution strategies:
- Multiple approach exploration
- Concurrent experimentation
- Rapid prototyping
- Comparison framework

#### `/poc-execute-parallel [poc-plan]`
Execute POC implementations using parallel processing for faster validation.

### API Development

#### `/api-contract-define [service]`
Define API contracts and interface specifications:
- Endpoint definitions
- Request/response schemas
- Error handling
- Versioning strategy

### Setup

#### `/install-prp`
Install and configure the PRP workflow system in your project:
- Create PRP directory structure
- Set up templates
- Configure settings
- Initialize workflow

## Agents

The PRP workflow system uses specialized agents for research and analysis. These agents are now available as a separate plugin for modularity and reuse.

**Note**: For detailed agent documentation and standalone usage, see the [prp-agents plugin](../prp-agents/README.md).

### Quick Reference

- **codebase-analyst**: Deep codebase pattern analysis and convention discovery
- **library-researcher**: External library documentation research and best practices

Both agents are automatically used during PRP creation commands and can be explicitly invoked via the Task tool.

### Installation

If you want to use these agents standalone or in other plugins:
```bash
/plugin install prp-agents@[marketplace-name]
```

## Configuration

The plugin can be configured through Claude Code settings:

```json
{
  "prp_directory": "./PRPs",           // Where PRP documents are stored
  "parallel_execution": true,          // Enable parallel POC execution
  "auto_research": true                // Auto-perform research during PRP creation
}
```

## Workflow Example

### Creating and Executing a New Feature

1. **Create the PRP**
   ```bash
   /base-create "Add user authentication"
   ```
   This will:
   - Research existing auth patterns in codebase
   - Find external documentation and examples
   - Generate comprehensive PRP document

2. **Review the PRP**
   The PRP will be saved to `PRPs/user-authentication.md`

3. **Execute the Implementation**
   ```bash
   /base-execute PRPs/user-authentication.md
   ```
   This implements the feature according to the PRP.

4. **Validate**
   The execution includes validation steps defined in the PRP.

## PRP Document Structure

Each PRP document contains:
- **Goal**: Feature goal, deliverable, and success definition
- **Context**: YAML structure with references, patterns, and gotchas
- **Implementation Tasks**: Dependency-ordered, actionable tasks
- **Validation Gates**: Project-specific validation commands
- **Final Checklist**: Comprehensive validation criteria

## Best Practices

1. **Research First**: Let the plugin perform thorough research before implementation
2. **Review PRPs**: Always review generated PRPs before execution
3. **Incremental Development**: Use task management for complex features
4. **Parallel POCs**: Explore multiple approaches for uncertain implementations
5. **Validation**: Ensure all validation gates pass before considering complete

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**PRP Generation Takes Long Time**
- This is normal - deep research optimizes for success over speed
- Check progress through spawned agent tasks

**Execution Fails**
- Verify PRP completeness
- Check all referenced files exist
- Ensure dependencies are installed

**Commands Not Available**
- Restart Claude Code after installation
- Verify plugin is enabled: `/plugin`
